Okay, I need to write a professional customer support reply based on the email summary and the given information. Let me start by understanding the key points. The user is asking how to reset their password, and there's a low urgency level. The helpful info mentions clicking on the 'Forgot Password' link and following instructions. Also, they want to know how to change their account email.

First, I should make sure the tone is professional and clear. Start with a friendly greeting, maybe "Hi [First Name]". Then state the purpose of the response. Since the urgency is low, I don't need to mention anything about immediate action. Instead, provide the steps directly. Make sure the answer is concise and direct. Check for any typos or errors. Also, include a closing that acknowledges the user's question and offers further assistance. Let me put that all together.

Hi [First Name],

To reset your password, please click on the "Forgot Password" option on the login page and follow the instructions provided.  

If you need to update your account email, please go to Account Settings > Email > Edit to change your address.  

Let me know if you need further assistance!  

Best regards,

Okay, the user wants me to write a professional customer support reply based on the email summary and the urgency. Let me start by understanding the key points. The main issue is that the export feature crashes when using PDF format. The urgency is low, so the response should be concise and focused.

First, I need to make sure the email is polite and clear. Start with a friendly greeting, like "Dear [Customer's Name]". Then state the problem clearly: the export crashes when selecting PDF. Mention the urgency as low, so maybe say "urgent" but keep it brief. Provide helpful info, so maybe suggest checking the system for updates or contacting support. End with a thank you and offer further assistance. Let me check if I'm missing any important details. Oh, maybe include a call to action, like offering a free trial or a support message. Alright, putting it all together in a professional tone.
